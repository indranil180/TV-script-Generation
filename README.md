# TV-script-Generation

This project was part of udacity nano degree in Deep learning using pytorch.
In this project i generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network i built will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
Dataset can be found in data/
